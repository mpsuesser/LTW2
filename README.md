LTW2!

Some quick but important notes:
* LineTowerWars, LineTowerWarsServer, and LineTowerWarsShared are all _separate_ Unity projects.


## LineTowerWars

The client project. Once being built, this project would be the downloadable, playable version.


## LineTowerWarsServer

The server project. Once being built, this project would be the version that gets run on the server side and manages a few things:
* The game settings
* The state of the game
* Connections between all active clients

The flow of the server build from start to finish looks like:
* Initialize the game settings
* Establish the lobby, wait for connections, manage the lobby state
* Start the game, wait for clients to be ready to begin the game, then initiate the actual game loop (i.e. begin the countdown to the start of the game)
* Maintain the state of the game in real time, until the game ends
* When the game loop finishes (i.e. someone wins), aggregate the stats, send them to the players, and upload the match data to a centralized backend DB

At its conclusion, the server should be killed. There is _not_ currently support for cleaning up the state and starting fresh for a new lobby.

## LineTowerWarsShared

Not really a playable build! This project intended to be the place I kept assets that are _shared_ between the client and server project. It's a messy way to keep things together and eventually should be retired in favor of a better, more automated system. Even as I write this, I'm pretty sure it's a bit out of sync with the actual client/server shared script directories because I got lazy and stopped copy/pasting updates to a _third_ project, and instead just kept in sync between client and server.

Also intends to be the place where map editing happens -- the "map" being the physical game world where a LTW match takes place (the lanes, the environment scene, etc).

Nobody else is working on this with me, so that's the high level stuff. Surely the finer details are important to getting onboarded, so... TODO: Improve this README and the general documentation before expecting anyone else to enjoy working on this!
